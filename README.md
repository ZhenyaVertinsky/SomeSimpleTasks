# SomeSimpleTasks
1. Write a program that calculates your weight on the moon, given that gravity is 16% of gravity on Earth.

2. Write a method that will increase each array element by 10%.

3. Display all even numbers from 1 to 100 (use remainder)

4. Display all odd digits from 1 to 15 (use modulo)

5. Display all even numbers from 1 to 100 without using the remainder of the division (using only a for loop)

6. Calculate the sum of digits from 20 to 200 and display the result on the screen (using the for loop)

7. Loop through the numbers 1 to 12 and output the name of the month corresponding to each number (using a loop and an if else statement)

8. Declare 2 variables of integer type. It is necessary to change the values ​​of the variables so that the value of the first is in the second, and the second is in the first.

9. Write a program with three integer type variables, assign values ​​to the first two, and assign their sum to the third variable. Display the value of the third variable on the screen.

10. Write a program with three integer type variables. Determine which one is the largest.

11. Write a program that uses two boolean variables, assign values ​​to them, and display for each variable the string "true" if the variable is true and "false" if the variable is false.

12. Write a program where two string variables are assigned values, and the third string variable is assigned the union (concatenation) of the two previous strings. Then print the value of the third string variable.

13. Create a program with two variables of integer type, assign them values, if the first variable is greater than the second, then increase its value by 3, otherwise increase the value of the second variable by 8. At the end of the program, display the values ​​of both numbers on the screen.

14. Display all numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop (all three options are possible in one program):
for
while
do while

15. Display a series of natural numbers from minimum to maximum with a step. For example, if the minimum is 10, the maximum is 35, the step is 5, then the output should be: 10 15 20 25 30 35. The minimum, maximum and step are specified by the user (can be hardcoded).

16. Divide all array elements by the value of the largest element of this array.

17. Write a method that converts rubles into dollars at a given rate. Specify the number of rubles and the exchange rate as arguments.
